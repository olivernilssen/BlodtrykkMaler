To launch the application, make sure you have an android emulator running
Using the VS Android SDK and Device manager is recommended

Make sure your VS and SDK's are updated to the latest versions as of 3rd of February

I have been using Pixel 3a (Android 10.0 - API 29) and it works fine on this emulator. 

Now to launch make sure you specify that you want to run the BlodtrykkMaler.Android project, if your emulator is running and connected it should then pop up as a valid debug option
Press run.
